I am a current undergraduate student at UC Merced aiming to pursue a career in Data Analytics. I have experience programming with C++ and multiple Python libraries such as PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I have also configured and trained models within R Studio (Leaps, MASS, pROC) and Microsoft Azure (Machine Learning Studio, Cognitive Services). 

I have also demonstrated open-mindedness, attention to detail, and leadership skills as both a section lead and executive board member for two on-campus dance organizations.

I am currently a freelance developer for two projects. The first of my ongoing projects is an AI-powered customer service system in which I program speech recognition tools. In my latest project, I am using React JS to design a parking program for San Francisco employees.
