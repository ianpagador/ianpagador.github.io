My name is Ian Pagador, and I'm from Livermore, CA. I am a current undergraduate student at UC Merced aiming to pursue a career in Data Analytics. I have experience programming with C++ and multiple Python libraries such as <b>PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib</b>. I have also configured and trained models within <b>R Studio (Leaps, MASS, pROC)</b> and <b>Microsoft Azure (Machine Learning Studio, Cognitive Services)</b>. 

I have also demonstrated open-mindedness, attention to detail, and leadership skills as both a section lead and executive board member for two on-campus dance organizations: <b>KAIROS and M4K at UC Merced</b>. Here, I have been involved in duties outside of my board position which include <b>maintaining audiovisual equipment</b>, <b>creating and mastering audio mixes for performances</b>, and <b>constructing promotional graphics for events</b>.

I am currently an IT Intern at the San Francisco Public Defender's Office. Here, I regularly create scripts in Python to automate tasks related to court hearings, manage SQL tables where court minutes data is stored, and transfer data from court minute documents to these tables.
