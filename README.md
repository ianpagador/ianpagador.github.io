# Welcome to Ian Pagador's Webpage!
I am a current undergraduate student at UC Merced aiming to pursue a career in Data Analytics. I have experience programming with C++ and multiple Python libraries such as PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I have also configured and trained models within R Studio (Leaps, MASS, pROC) and Microsoft Azure (Machine Learning Studio, Cognitive Services).
